    Customized Google Maps for Auslandsdienst:<br>
    It was my job to transfer and visualize the data on a Google Map and a construct
    a list with details about each place. Of course, the data isn't entered manually
    but taken from a database which updates when there's a change in Podio (Collaboration
    Platform of the Auslandsdienst). Expanding a WP plugin (built by my predecessor) I
    also added the creation of a new database for a new app displaying a table of past
    and future conferences.<br>

    Airforce ROTC Inventory Excel:<br>
    Created a few VBA functions and macros to interlink printable cadet clothing
    forms (where cadets were able to see what they were issued and how much of it)
     with a master Inventory sheet for leadership. This significantly simplified
     inventory checks and changes. I can send you the sample xlsm file upon request.

    Bio Farm Website redesign:<br>
  Redesigned with Wordpress a small Family Farm's website. Handled WP installation,
   domain reassignment, hosting details and trained the Owners in the use of the
   WP dashboard. I'm providing continued support although extremely little of it
   is necessary.<br>
