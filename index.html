    <div id="about_me">
        I’m currently a Business Informatics major at the University of Vienna in Austria. 
        Don’t be fooled by the name as this is a Computer Science major with an emphasis on enterprises 
        (I had to take the CS entrance exam after all). Previously I studied Business Administration 
        at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.<br><br><br>

        Background and Philosophy:<br>
        Born in Austria, I was fortunate to complete high school in the United States,
        and spend time on the west coast, east coast and midwest. 
        At University the idea of value driven production and design impacted me deeply. 
        Professional as well as personally I aim to never create a solution to a non-existent problem.
        And I don’t think that can be said for everyone. My four college level courses in 2D/3D Design,
        Figure Drawing and Portrait Drawing developed my artistic side and I believe that value can come from many places.
        Transferring Universities has been challenging in many ways but I’ve never been happier with what direction my life is taking.

        <div style="text-align: center;">This Website. <br>
          Have you broken it yet? <br>
          And put it back together? <br>
          I have. <br>
          About a million times. <br><br><br></div>
        

        Deep Dream Graphical User Interface:<br>
        I’m intrigued by Google’s Deep Dream but was frustrated by the long rendering time and lack of visual organizations. 
        I decided to build 3 different levels of complexity. First, a menu with small thumbnails gives an initial impression 
        of each feature. Second, native feature visualization creates a small (300x300) picture within seconds. 
        Third, an overlaying of the feature on an image or native feature which can take the good part of a minute.
        I added image classification and have the intention to expand the project to make feature creation more intuitive.<br><br>
        
        Website for Biogärtnerei Florian Kamlah:<br>
        Badly in need of a website redesign I built the website for this family farm. Initially I wanted to use a framework 
        like Angular but I soon realized that the ideal solution was not the most technically sophisticated one. An all in 
        one hosting and web design service proved to be the most economical and requires the least effort to update. Even though 
        I didn’t get to implement and expand my Angular knowledge I did provide the most value added solution to the customer, 
        for which, of course, I was compensated.
