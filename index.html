    <div id="about_me">
        I’m currently a Business Informatics major at the University of Vienna in Austria. 
        Don’t be fooled by the name as this is a Computer Science major with an emphasis on enterprises 
        (I had to take the CS entrance exam). Previously I studied Business Administration 
        at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.<br><br><br>

        <br><br>Background and Philosophy:<br>
        Born in Austria, I was fortunate to complete high school in the United States,
        and spend time on the West Coast, East Coast and in the Midwest. 
        At University the idea of value driven production and design impacted me deeply. 
        Professional as well as personally I aim to never create a solution to a non-existent problem.
        And I don’t think that can be said for everyone. My four college level courses in 2D/3D Design,
        Figure Drawing and Portrait Drawing developed my artistic side and I believe that value can come from many places.
        Transferring Universities has been challenging in many ways but I’ve never been happier with what direction my life is taking.
